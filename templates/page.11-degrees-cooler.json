Koroyd can use up to 78% of the material thickness to absorb energy from an impact, while EPS foam densifies when around only 60% of the material thickness is compressed. Learn more about how Koroyd provides superior protection while keeping you cool.</p>",

Koroyd protects the skull and brain from both direct and angled impacts.</li><li><strong>Reduce heat stress</strong> with consistent airflow through Koroyd's open-cell structure, which allows hot air from the head to escape easily.</li><li><strong>Visual end-of-life indicator</strong>: regardless of the material, helmets must be replaced after an impact. Koroyd's compressive structure visibly shows damage after an impact, making it easier to know when a replacement is needed.</li><li><strong>Lightweight construction</strong>: featuring the world's thinnest walled tubes, the Koroyd structure is 95% air, providing reduced weight and enhanced comfort.</li><li>The <strong>all-Koroyd and plastic construction</strong> allows for washing (less odor and grime buildup).</li><li><strong>Lower overall ride height</strong> compared to competitor foam-based helmets, resulting in less short-term removal compared to foam-based helmets.</li></ul>",
